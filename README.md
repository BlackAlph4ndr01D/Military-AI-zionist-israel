# Military AI zionist israel



# 📖 Lists of Zionist Military AI Systems

This repository documents the integration of **artificial intelligence (AI)** into Israel’s military infrastructure.  
It serves as a **public archive** to expose algorithmic warfare, surveillance technologies, and BigTech involvement in Gaza and the West Bank.  
The goal is to **counter propaganda** and preserve the voice of Palestine through transparent documentation.

---

## 🌍 Overview
Israel has rapidly deployed AI in:
- Drones & robotics
- Surveillance & facial recognition
- Cyber & psychological operations
- Missile defense systems
- BigTech cloud and GPU infrastructure

These systems raise global concerns about **digital apartheid, predictive policing, and algorithmic targeting**.
